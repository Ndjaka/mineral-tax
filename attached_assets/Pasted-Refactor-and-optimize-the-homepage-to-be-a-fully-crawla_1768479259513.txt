Refactor and optimize the homepage to be a fully crawlable, SEO-friendly, and high-conversion landing page for a Swiss B2B SaaS.

Context:
This is a micro-SaaS called "MineralTax" that simplifies the declaration and refund of the Swiss mineral oil tax for companies.

GOALS:
- Make the homepage readable by bots, crawlers, and SEO tools (no JS required to see main content).
- Improve clarity of the value proposition in under 3 seconds.
- Increase conversion for a regulated Swiss B2B audience.
- Preserve all existing application logic and functionality.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. HTML & Crawlability
- Serve meaningful HTML on initial load.
- Ensure all main marketing text is visible in raw HTML source.
- Avoid JS-only rendering for the homepage.
- Keep the app loading after the static content.

2. SEO Basics
- Add an optimized <title> tag.
- Add a clear <meta name="description">.
- Use one single <h1> with a strong value proposition.
- Use semantic <h2> sections.

3. Copywriting (French)
- Clear, simple, non-technical language.
- Switzerland-specific wording.
- Focus on benefits: time saved, compliance, reduced risk.
- Avoid buzzwords and vague SaaS language.

Suggested H1:
"Déclaration simplifiée de la taxe sur les huiles minérales en Suisse"

4. Page Structure
Add the following sections using semantic HTML:
- Hero section with H1, short subtitle, and one primary CTA.
- How it works (3 simple steps).
- Who it is for (target company types).
- Swiss compliance and regulation reassurance (Taxas / OFDF, without claiming official affiliation).
- Pricing section clearly stating 250 CHF / year.
- Final CTA.

5. CTA
- Add one primary call-to-action above the fold.
- Use action-oriented wording such as:
  "Commencer la déclaration"
  or "Voir un exemple conforme Taxas"

6. Compliance & Trust
- Explicitly mention Swiss regulation.
- Reference Taxas and OFDF factually.
- Do not imply official endorsement.
- Emphasize correctness and compliance.

7. Non-goals
- Do NOT redesign the UI.
- Do NOT remove or break existing JS/app logic.
- Do NOT introduce unnecessary complexity.

FINAL CHECK:
The homepage must be fully understandable and informative even if JavaScript is disabled.
